# Deepseek-GenAI

#### Introduction to DeepSeek-R1 and the Project Overview

In this project, we aim to develop an end-to-end generative AI application leveraging the DeepSeek-R1 model. Released in January 2025, this model is designed for advanced reasoning tasks, directly competing with OpenAI's models in performance but with a lower cost structure. With 671 billion parameters and a context length of 128,000, DeepSeek-R1 is a powerhouse for AI applications.

Our goal is to create a generative AI app that can chat with memory, retaining chat history and integrating seamlessly with Langchain. This guide will walk you through the process step by step, ensuring you can replicate the setup on your local machine without sending data to external servers.
